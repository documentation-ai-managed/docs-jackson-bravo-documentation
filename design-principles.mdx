## Core Design Principles

At Jackson Bravo, our design philosophy revolves around empowering designers while maintaining simplicity and elegance. We believe that great design should be both beautiful and functional, creating experiences that delight users and serve their needs effectively.

<Callout kind="info">These principles guide every aspect of our platform, from user interface design to feature development.</Callout>

## Principle 1: Simplicity in Complexity

We strive to make complex design tasks simple through intuitive interfaces and smart automation. Our tools handle the technical heavy lifting, allowing you to focus on your creative vision.

## Principle 2: Visual Hierarchy

Clear visual hierarchy guides users through your content, ensuring important information stands out while maintaining a cohesive design flow.

        --primary-color: #3B82F6;
        --secondary-color: #10B981;
        --accent-color: #F59E0B;
      }
      
      .hero {
        background-color: var(--primary-color);
        color: white;
      }
      ```
      ```scss
      $colors: (
        primary: #3B82F6,
        secondary: #10B981,
        accent: #F59E0B
      );
      
      .hero {
        background-color: map-get($colors, primary);
      }
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Principle 3: Responsive Design

Every design created on Jackson Bravo automatically adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring your work looks perfect on all devices.

<ExpandableGroup>
  <Expandable title="Mobile-First Approach" default-open="true">
    We design for mobile devices first, then enhance for larger screens.
  </Expandable>
  <Expandable title="Flexible Layouts" default-open="false">
    Grid systems that automatically adjust based on content and screen size.
  </Expandable>
</ExpandableGroup>

## Principle 4: Accessibility First

We believe great design is inclusive design. All our templates and tools are built with accessibility in mind, following WCAG guidelines.

```javascript
function ensureAccessibility(element) {
  // Add ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
  element.setAttribute('aria-label', 'Design element');
  element.setAttribute('tabindex', '0');
  
  // Ensure sufficient color contrast
  const contrastRatio = calculateContrast(element);
  if (contrastRatio < 4.5) {
    console.warn('Low contrast detected');
  }
  
  return element;
}
```

## Principle 5: Performance Matters

Beautiful designs should load quickly. We optimize every aspect of our platform for speed, from image compression to efficient code delivery.
